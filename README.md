# password_manager_for_usb
This is a simple python code for a password manager that can write, view, and store passwords onto a usb stick.

After starting the code, you will be prompted to enter the master password. This is then checked against the set password to authenticate the user. Once in, there is a display for you to use for the manager itself.

This is my first commit, so there might be some issues with the commit itself, but I hope you can enjoy!
